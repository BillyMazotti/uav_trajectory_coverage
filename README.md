Code used for *Remote Identification Trajectory Coverage in Urban Air Mobility Applications*.

Using OpenStreetMap (organized by MyGeoData) data to model building, customer, and vendor 
locations in US cities and determine the required number of 
randomly distributed sensors to achieve a desired trajectory coverage portion for various path 
planning algorithms (straight-line, RRT*).


If you find our code useful and would like to use it for your own project, please cite our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09653).


## Code for Data Preparation and Experimentation will be uploaded soon!
